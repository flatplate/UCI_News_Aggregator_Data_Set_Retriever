# UCI_News_Aggregator_Data_Set_Retriever


Want to work on a natural language processing project that involves categorizing news 
articles but can't find a good data set anywhere on the internet?

You're lucky then because here's a tool that can literally make the data set for you!

This tool uses the News Aggregator Data Set (which has been reorganized into smaller 
files in the rawData directory) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

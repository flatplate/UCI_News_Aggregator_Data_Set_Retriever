# UCI_News_Aggregator_Data_Set_Retriever


Want to work on a natural language processing project that involves categorizing news 
articles but can't find a good data set anywhere on the internet?

You're lucky then because here's a tool that can literally make the data set for you!

This tool uses the UCI News Aggregator Data Set (which has been reorganized into smaller 
files in the rawData directory).

Fed's Charles Plosser sees high bar for change in pace of tapering,"Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn't enough to change the pace of the central bank's asset purchases.  ""It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,"" Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed's tapering of its stimulus programme. ""Given the fact that we've embarked on measured reductions, it's important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we're doing. It's OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.""  The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.  New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a ""reasonably favorable"" outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a ""considerable time.""  The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.  No Whip-Saw  Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.  Policy shouldn't be ""whip-sawed from month to month,"" Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were ""encouraging,"" though they follow other data in the previous two months that were ""weak,"" he said.  Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.  The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn't find work.  Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank's district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.

Fed's Plosser: Nasty Weather Has Curbed Job Growth,"Severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest a bit of weakness in the labor market is only temporary.    In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February. ""All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather,"" he said according to prepared remarks.    A government report on Friday showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.    Plosser is a long-time critic of the Fed's aggressive bond-buying program, which is meant to spur hiring and economic growth, but which policymakers have trimmed in measured steps despite some weak growth in jobs, manufacturing and retail sales in the world's largest economy so far this year.    Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.    © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Fed's Plosser: Taper pace may be too slow,"PARISn - The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said Monday.  ""We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,"" Plosser told a panel in Paris. ""Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.""  Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.  As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.  But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.  ""If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,"" Plosser said.  He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.  ""Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,"" he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

Fed's Plosser expects US unemployment to fall to 6.2% by the end of 2014,"FXStreet (Łódź) - Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said today in a speech delivered at the Bank of France alongside Governor Christian Noyer that he expected US unemployment to drop even lower than 6.2% by the end of the year.    The voting FOMC member suggested that the last three Nonfarm Payrolls monthly readings were weaker due to the ""effect of the unusually severe winter weather,"" but that he expected the US labor market to improve from now on.    He also suggested that the US economy would expand by around 3% this year and that upside risks to inflation existed in the longer term.    Plosser, a critic of the Fed's quantitative easing program, also expressed hope that the central bank's monetary policy would return to ""normalcy"" as soon as possible.",b,ddUyU0VZz0BRneMioxUPQVP6sIxvM
ECB unlikely to end sterilization of SMP purchases: traders,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not stop sterilizing bond purchases it made at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis, a majority of euro money market traders polled by Reuters said.  The euro sign landmark is seen at the headquarters (R) of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt September 2, 2013. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach  The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.  In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it ""sterilizes"" the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.  Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.  Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday's monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.  In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be ""relatively limited"".  The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB's three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.  The euro zone's central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks' coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.  Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.  This week's repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc's financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.  Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.  The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.  Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.
